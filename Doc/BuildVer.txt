BuildVer modification

This version process version info only from rc-files from dependent files and -release build only.
So version info can be in another named file and directory.
This might be a problem with this one :-\

Good points ;)
If version info is alone in Project1Ver.rc in project Project1, only Project1Ver.rc is compiled in every build.
